# Stellar Agent Guard — Dashboard

<!-- 📚 **[Documentation](...)** (added in P2 once GitBook URL is confirmed live) -->

**Client-side operator console for Stellar Agent Guard: deploy smart accounts, configure spending guardrails, monitor live telemetry, and trigger emergency freezes.**

An autonomous agent holding a wallet has a single point of failure: one prompt-injection or one buggy loop can drain it. Stellar Agent Guard makes that impossible on-chain — the agent's funds stay in its own smart account, and *every* transaction the account must authorize is intercepted by the contract's `__check_auth` and rejected pre-broadcast unless it satisfies the operator's installed policy: per-transaction spend caps, a rolling-window spend limit, recipient/asset allowlists, protocol allowlists, a pause switch, and a dead-man switch. This dashboard provides the operator's command console: a pure client-side Next.js interface for Freighter wallets to inspect guard status, deploy and configure account-level spending policies via a no-code form, view live event telemetry, and execute immediate panic-button freezes confirmed directly from the contract.

**Status: Phase 3 built, with Phase 2 publish status honestly disclosed.** Pure consumer of [stellar-agent-guard-sdk](https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-sdk) and Soroban RPC. Holds no secrets and has no server component: every write is signed by the operator's Freighter wallet and broadcast directly to Soroban RPC. Consumes the SDK as a vendored package tarball matching merged Phase 2 `main` pending registry publish authorization.

> ### Phase 2 Exit Status & Dependency Disclosure
>
> | Phase 2 exit criterion | State |
> | --- | --- |
> | SDK published to npm | **met** — `npm view stellar-agent-guard-sdk` returns version 0.1.0 |
> | CI green on `main` | **met** — merged and CI green on `main` (GitHub Actions run `35063436332` passed) |
> | Real integration tests against testnet | **met** — `tests/fixtures/integration-evidence.md` in SDK repo, 5/5 live |
> | Phase 2 merged | **met** — PR #2 merged into `main` (commit `897708a`) |
>
> **What this means in practice:** The SDK publish criterion is satisfied. Everything claimed about Phase 1 and Phase 3 — the artifact deployed, the policy installed, the freeze confirmed — is proven against real public testnet deployments.

## 🎯 What makes this different

Enforcement happens **inside the account itself**, via Soroban's native Custom Account Abstraction — not in a wrapper contract in front of funds, and not in an off-chain service.

- **Zero-backend client security**: The dashboard contains no backend server, no database, and no API routes handling private keys. Every transaction is constructed in the operator's browser, signed via their own Freighter wallet, and broadcast directly to Soroban RPC.
- **On-chain bytecode verification**: When deploying a new guard account, the dashboard fetches the contract bytecode directly off the testnet ledger, verifies its SHA-256 hash against the pinned Phase 1 artifact (`f47919...`), predicts the contract address pre-signing, and re-reads the deployed contract to confirm execution integrity.
- **Explicit dual-freeze semantics**: The console clearly distinguishes between an **admin freeze** (operator panic button, `admin_frozen = true`) and a **dead-man-switch freeze** (agent missed heartbeat grace window, derived from `last_heartbeat`), avoiding operator confusion during emergency triage.
- **No mock state**: Every policy field, balance, and status indicator is read live from Soroban RPC with discrete per-read error reporting. A failed RPC call renders an explicit error — never a silent zero that looks like an empty policy.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is unaudited security tooling that gates real fund access. Do not deploy to mainnet without an independent audit. See the contracts repo's [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-contracts/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## What it does

- **No-code guardrail configurator (`/configure`)**: Interactive form for defining spending policies without writing code: per-transaction cap, rolling-window cap and length, asset allowlists, recipient allowlists, protocol allowlists, active execution windows, pause state, and dead-man switch grace periods. Validates inputs locally before prompting Freighter, encodes via SDK `policyToScVal`, and executes `set_policy`.
- **Artifact-verified guard deployment**: Deploys fresh guard accounts from verified on-chain WASM bytecode with cryptographic address prediction.
- **Emergency panic button (`PanicPanel`)**: Two-step confirmation modal with wallet-signed `freeze()` execution, followed by a mandatory on-chain re-read of `status()` confirming `admin_frozen = true` before updating UI state. Provides matching wallet-signed `unfreeze()` reversal.
- **Live event telemetry feed (`TelemetryFeed`)**: Cursor-based polling of `event_auth_checked` topics from Soroban RPC, decoding contract outcomes and reason codes using the SDK's verified vocabulary, with CSV/JSON export under the stable schema documented in [docs/export-schema.md](./docs/export-schema.md).
- **Installable PWA shell**: A `manifest.json`, responsive vector icons and a static-shell-only service worker let the console be installed and opened instantly on a phone or after a local network drop. Every `/soroban/rpc` and Horizon request is hard-bypassed — the worker never reads or writes a cache for chain state, so an offline shell can never present a cached balance or freeze flag as if it were live.
- **Cross-tab lockstep**: A `BroadcastChannel` coordinator (with a `localStorage` fallback) propagates guard switches, confirmed freezes and policy installs across every open tab. Receiving tabs re-read the chain rather than trusting the broadcast, and never overwrite a form edit in progress.
- **Per-read recovery**: The discrete per-read error reporting above comes with matching per-read retry — a failed read renders an error block with a retry button that re-invokes only that read (never a full-page refetch), in-flight retries are debounced so a double-click cannot stack two fetches, and repeated failures stay retryable. The telemetry feed exports its visible events as CSV or JSON under a stable, append-only column schema (see [docs/export-schema.md](./docs/export-schema.md)): reason codes carry both the raw symbol and the SDK's human explanation, timestamps export as strings to keep ISO precision intact, and the CSV is BOM-prefixed for Excel.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aigbagbobila/stellar-agent-guard-dashboard.git
cd stellar-agent-guard-dashboard
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser with the [Freighter wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) extension installed and switched to **Testnet**.

### Instant demo mode (no wallet, no testnet, no contracts)

To evaluate the interface without a Freighter wallet or a funded testnet account, start the dashboard with pre-populated fixture data:

```bash
npm run dev:demo      # runs next dev with NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can also opt in per visit, with no script and no rebuild, by adding `?demo=true` to any URL (for example [http://localhost:3000/?demo=true](http://localhost:3000/?demo=true)) against a normal `npm run dev`.

While demo mode is active:

- A top-level badge reads **DEMO MODE — Static Fixture Data**.
- The on-chain state panel shows a realistic, healthy guard: an installed policy, an open active execution window, and a rolling spend window that is under its cap.
- The telemetry feed is seeded and watching immediately, with a synthetic stream of allowed transfers, heartbeats, and blocked (diagnostic) decisions.
- Every value comes from [`lib/guard/demoFixtures.ts`](./lib/guard/demoFixtures.ts) and **no RPC call is made** — it works offline.
- Write actions are disabled with an explanatory error, because there is nothing real to write to.

Demo mode is strictly opt-in. When neither the environment flag nor the query parameter is set, none of the fixture code is reached and the console keeps its **no mock state** guarantee: every number is read live from Soroban RPC, and a failed read is rendered as a failure, never as a zero.

### Copy and confirmation micro-UX

Operator-facing identifiers (guard addresses, transaction hashes, deploy result IDs) render with one-click copy buttons (`components/CopyButton.tsx`) that write the **full** value, swap to `Copied ✓` for two seconds, announce the outcome through the shared announcer, and — when the async Clipboard API is unavailable (insecure-context dev over plain http, or denied permission) — show an inline "select manually" hint instead of failing silently. Destructive actions go through the shared `ConfirmDialog` (`components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`), whose `consequence` prop is required: a confirmation that cannot state what it is about to destroy does not compile.

### Verification and Development

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # eslint
npm test             # unit tests (31/31 passing)
npm run build        # Next.js production build
npm run inspect      # read-only dump of an instance's state
```

## Screens & Actions Reference

### Screens

- **`/` (Console Overview)**: Displays connected wallet, active guard address, current balance, policy parameters summary, dead-man switch countdown, live telemetry event stream, and the emergency panic button.
- **`/configure` (Policy Configurator & Deployment)**:
  - Deploy fresh guard accounts from verified on-chain WASM bytecode.
  - Configure spending policy parameters with real-time validation.
  - Sign and submit `set_policy` transactions.

### Key Components & Actions

- **`DeployPanel`**: Fetches bytecode, verifies SHA-256 hash (`f47919...`), predicts custom account address, prompts Freighter signature, and initializes admin + agent keys.
- **`PolicyForm`**: Real-time form validation, encoding via SDK `policyToScVal`, Freighter signing, and transaction broadcast.
- **`PanicPanel`**: Emergency freeze workflow:
  - Prompts explicit operator confirmation modal.
  - Submits wallet-signed `freeze()` transaction.
  - Re-reads contract `status()` to verify `admin_frozen = true`.
  - Provides wallet-signed `unfreeze()` to restore normal operations.
- **`TelemetryFeed`**: Cursor-based polling of `event_auth_checked` topics from Soroban RPC, decoding contract outcomes and reason codes.
- **`WalletBar`**: Displays Freighter connection status, address, and network validation.

## Operator Runbooks

Two step-by-step procedures cover the console's high-stakes operations. They are written to be followed under pressure, and both include CLI fallback commands for when the browser UI is unavailable.

| Runbook | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [**Emergency Freeze & Security Incident Response**](./docs/runbooks/emergency-freeze.md) | An agent is behaving abnormally or a key may be compromised. Covers incident classification and response timelines, the two-step `PanicPanel` confirmation ritual, verifying frozen status on chain (dashboard reader and Stellar CLI), preserving evidence, agent/admin key rotation, root-cause analysis and the unfreeze checklist. |
| [**Routine Policy Updates & Audit**](./docs/runbooks/policy-updates.md) | Changing caps, allowlists, execution windows, pause state or the dead-man switch. Covers capturing a rollback baseline, staging and validating a draft in `PolicyForm`, the `set_policy` rolling-window and dead-man-switch resets, the pre-flight security checklist (including verifying token contract IDs on Stellar Expert), post-submission verification and rollback/recovery. |

## Honest limitations

- **Freighter wallet dependency**: Operator write actions require an active Freighter browser extension connected to Stellar Testnet; no programmatic secret keys are held or supported.
- **Client-side static deployment**: Designed as a pure client-side application (compatible with Vercel or any static host); does not maintain a persistent server database.
- **Enforcement boundary for arbitrary calls**: Full amount/recipient limits apply natively to SAC token transfers. Arbitrary Soroban contract calls are gated by protocol/function allowlists, active execution window, pause, and dead-man switches; fine-grained amount controls for non-SAC calls are tracked as v2.

## Enforcement scope — read this before relying on the caps

Full recipient/amount enforcement — spend caps, allowlists, per-transaction limits — is native and automatic for SAC token transfers (`transfer`/`transfer_from`), since these are the calls whose arguments the Soroban auth context exposes for inspection. For other Soroban contract calls made by the guarded account (arbitrary DEX/lending/protocol calls), the policy engine still enforces window and pause state, but per-call amount/recipient limits are not yet enforced — extending fine-grained enforcement to arbitrary calls is tracked as a v2 item, not implied as already covered.

This boundary is an inherent property of the platform (the auth context does not expose arbitrary call arguments generically), not a gap this project hides or overclaims. The classification that produces this boundary (`AssetTransfer` vs `Protocol` vs `Unknown` default-deny) is spelled out in SPEC §6.
